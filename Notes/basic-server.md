# Creating a basic server
- create a socket
- check if the socket creation was successful
- set members of sockaddr_in to store the address and port
	- use htons to convert port number from little-endian to big-endian(host byte order to network byte order) 
	- use inet_aton to convert address from little-endian "numbers and dots" format to numeric binary big-endian(host byte order to network byte order) 
- bind the socket to the server address and port
	- check errors
- listen to connections
	- accept connections in an infinite loop
	- receive bytes (recv)
