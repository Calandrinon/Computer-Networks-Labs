# Number guess problem
A client server implementation in python for the number guess problem from lab 2, but this time with UDP sockets. 

> The server chooses a random number. 

> The clients connect and send numbers to server. 

> The server returns to each client a status message:

> - 'H' – send a larger number

> - 'S' – send a lower number

> - 'G' – you guessed my number

> - 'L' - another client guessed the number. You lost!
